# EDA_algorithms
This project focuses on the EDA algorithm that deals with the physical design part of ASIC flow.
The First Algorithm deals with partitioning a genetic netlist into two groups following Kernighanâ€“Lin algorithm, with a test case and output partitioned netlist.
The second part deals with optimizing the area of the physical layer by applying shape function optimizing algorithms to get the shape and aspect possible aspects 
A test case netlist is uploaded of each block and compline them into one circuit.
The last part the concerned with placing the blocks into two-by-four grids in order to get the most optimized cut length between the gate, it gives a printed output
describing the grid for the given netlist.
